# Getting Started

Decentralized Task System is a smart contract that manages a task system such as creating tasks, completing tasks, and verifying tasks in a decentralized manner. Creating a more transparent and fair environment.

# Main Functionality
- createTask() function allows users to create new tasks with the requirement that the user pay a certain amount of ether.
- assignmentTask() function allows other users (other than the task owner) to work on available tasks. The user will choose the task they want to do and the user must pay a certain amount of ether so that the user is truly committed to completing the task.
- verifyTask() function has a function for task owners to verify the tasks they own. The task owner will reward the party who has successfully completed the task and the party who successfully completes the task will have their reputation increased. This helps each user to grow their own trust.
- createReport() function allows users to report to other users. This is necessary so that when fraud occurs by other users, users who get a bad reputation can no longer carry out activities in the smart contract.
- verifyReport() is a function that is used to verify whether the report created can really be trusted or is only used to attack certain parties.
